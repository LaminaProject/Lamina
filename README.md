## About

This project is a fork of [UPBGE 0.2.5](https://github.com/UPBGE/upbge/tree/upbge0.2.5). The goal here isn't to compete with UPBGE or any other engine — it's simply to make small improvements to the codebase, specifically the ones I ([snew-cc](https://github.com/snew-cc)) have the knowledge to do.

As we know, this codebase is large and was built by many contributors, so I can’t handle everything on my own. If you're able to help, feel free to open a pull request — I’d be glad to accept it.
